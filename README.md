# dino-bot-3000
A simple bot to play Google's dinosaur game using neural networks and genetic algorithms to get smarter.

## How to use
1. Make sure you have node.js installed
2. Download/clone this respository to a folder on your computer
3. Open terminal/command prompt/whatever you use and make sure you're in the directory where you cloned/downloaded this repository
4. Run `node index`
5. Go to `127.0.0.1:8000/index.html` in a web browser (the ip address and port can be changed in the `index.js` file for your convinence)
6. Sit back and watch the magic happen!


**NOTE:** When you first run the bot, the dinosaur may not show up on your screen. Do not worry, just minimize and reopen your browser, and the dinosaur should show up. Also the bot will continue to run the background, but don't minimize the window or open a new tab or else the game will pause and the bot will stop running. Refocusing on the game will unpause the game and continue the bot.

**NOTE #2:** The bot is very memory intensive so after a long time (6 hours or longer) your web browser may crash cause it ran out of memory. I'm currently trying to figure out why it's using a lot of memory, and hopefully I can update the bot so it can run for as long as you'd like without using too much memory.

If there are any issues/questions, feel free to open an issue and I'd be happy to answer.
